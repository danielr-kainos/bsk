Simple Mandatory Access Control implementation using PHP and PostgreSQL. Created for 
*Comuputer Systems Security* (*Bezpieczeństwo Systemów Komputerowych*) class at Gdańsk University of Technology.  
This codebase is a caricature of MVC and is overally terrible, but works. Hope it'll help somebody.
